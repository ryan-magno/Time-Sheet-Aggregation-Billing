# Success #[ID]: [Short Descriptive Name]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Session/Context:** [What were you building — keep generic, e.g., "AI Agent workflow with MCP integration"]

---

## The Win
[2–3 sentences. What specifically went right? First-try success, unusually clean mapping, flawless agent behavior, zero corrections needed — be precise about what was impressive.]

---

## Why It Worked — User Factors
[Identify the exact user actions and decisions that produced this outcome.]

- [e.g., Prompt included exact JSON schema as reference]
- [e.g., Context was cleared right before the complex request]
- [e.g., Used explicit node names throughout the prompt]
- [e.g., Defined success criteria upfront]

**The Key Ingredient:** [The single most important thing the user did right. One sentence.]

---

## The Setup
**Context state:** [How long was the conversation? Was context fresh or carried over?]
**Approach taken:** [What strategy did the user use — e.g., broke it into steps, provided examples, used a template?]
**Tools/nodes involved:** [Which n8n nodes or integrations were central to the win?]

---

## The Triggering Prompt

```text
[Exact prompt — verbatim. Do not paraphrase. This is the most important field.]
```

---

## Reproducibility
**Can this be replicated?** [Yes / No / Partially]
**What made it replicable:** [What conditions need to be in place for this to work again?]
**Standard practice recommendation:** [Should this prompting approach become part of the user's default workflow? If yes, describe exactly how.]

---

## Pattern Check
**First time this worked?** [Yes / No — if No, this approach is becoming reliable]
**What changed from previous attempts?** [If applicable — what was different this time that made it click?]

---

## One-Line Lesson
[One actionable takeaway the user should internalize and repeat. Frame it as a rule or habit.]
